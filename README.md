# SDN-Intrusion-Detection

## INTRODUCTION:

Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become an important technology in the field of networking due to its flexibility, scalability, and easy management. However, with the increase in the complexity and scale of network infrastructure, the number and types of network attacks have also increased, making it essential to have a robust intrusion detection system in place to identify and prevent these attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical defense tools that aid network users in protecting themselves against online threats.

## Motivation and Goals:

The primary motivation behind developing an accurate and efficient network intrusion detection system for SDNs is to ensure the protection of sensitive information against various online threats. As the use of SDNs continues to grow, the risk of cyber-attacks also increases, and it becomes imperative to have a robust security system in place to detect and prevent such attacks. The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms in detecting network intrusion in an SDN. Machine learning algorithms can learn from patterns in the data and can be trained to accurately identify several types of network traffic, including normal traffic and traffic that indicates malicious activity. By applying these algorithms to the data collected from the SDN, we aim to achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall while minimizing false positives and false negatives

## Dataset Description:

For this project, we will be using the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 2017 dataset, which is a publicly available dataset frequently used in research. The dataset was collected in a lab setting using various attack tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, and Hping3, and it includes a tabular record of everyday real-time traffic. The dataset contains 79 features, where one feature denotes a qualitative attribute, and the remaining 78 features denote quantitative attributes. The dataset was originally a Packet Capture file (PCAP).
